# Project 1: Titanic Dataset
This first project is a machine learning task on the Titanic Database. You can find some basic cleaning techniques of the NaN values and some conversion of the categorical features to numeric ones. No much analysis is provided though as the Titanic dataset was extensively researched by many individuals already and a big library exists in Kaggle.

## Goals:
(1). Is it possible to create a model to predict whether a passenger survived or not the accident based on given features? 
(2). How accurately and what is the best algorithm to make this prediction?

# Project 2: Anime Dataset
The second project is an Exploratory Data Analysis task on the Anime World database. You can find some columns/ rowsÂ´ processing along with some techniques to present Word Clouds.

## Goals:
1). What are the biggest Studios?
The word biggest is a bit vague but for the sake of this analysis we state that we refer to the total number of animes that it has produced. If it is above a certain number of animes, it is clasified as big studio. We will need further evidence though to tell what what is the threshold number.

2). What are the most active genres in production?
In this research question we will examine the most active genres in production of our database. A decision has to be made though on what is treated as most active genres from the ones we have. Also, there is a challenge. Some of those animes are categorized in more than one genre.

3). What are the most commonly used keywords for the Description feature?
For this research question we will use the description feature and try to create Word Clouds. This is a very exciting process and allows us to acquire some value and of course conduct further analysis if needed. We will run the Word Cloud three times, filtering out, each time, some words that might not give us much value.

Soure: All Datasets were imported from Kaggle.
